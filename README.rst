Why?
========

Because I want to use cucumber rather than any of the Python knock-offs.
Especially want something to work in conjunction with the django-nose
plugin and test runner so that I can use cucumber for acceptance testing
for my Django projects.

Warning
=======

This is pre-alpha and is my first nose plugin, so there are no
guarantees that this will work for you. It kinda works for me, but
there's still plenty more to do.
